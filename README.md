## Here are some practical tasks for ones that are learning SQL. 

* Hardness evolve from *D0* to *D9*, *team_0* placed somewhere in the middle of the list and *team_1* in the end. The data for the practice is placed in [*materials* folder](materials/model.sql). *Src* folders contain the finished tasks. Each of *D*s is dedicated to different topic.
	* [D0](D0/README_D0.md)
	* [D1](D1/README_D1.md)
	* [D2](D2/README_D2.md)
	* [D3](D3/README_D3.md)
	* [D4](D4/README_D4.md)
    * [Team_0](T0/README_T0.md)
	* [D5](D5/README_D5.md)
	* [D6](D6/README_D6.md)
	* [D7](D7/README_D7.md)
	* [D8](D8/README_D8.md)
	* [D9](D9/README_D9.md)
    * [Team_1](T1/README_T1.md)

* [*Theoretical questions.md*](/Theoretical_questions.md) include some information from a SQL exam.

* [*file_maker.sh*](/file_maker.sh) will help you create your own solution files faster.
